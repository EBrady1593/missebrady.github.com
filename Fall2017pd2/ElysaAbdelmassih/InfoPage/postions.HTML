				<h1> Positions</h1>
					<p> The positions in soccer isnt very hard to learn we usally play it in a 3 2 3 2 way in the back is the goalie which is not counted on the feild. In front of the goalie is the 3 defenders and they try to defend the ball and help the goalie make sure the ball doesnt go in the net. In front of the defense is the defensive mids which is combanation of defense and mid together so they help the defense. In front of the defensive mids are the midfeilders they have to run up and back and make sure the ball doesnt get to the defense they also help out fowards where they assit goals usally. In front of the mids are the fowards they start with the ball so the game starts and they are in front so they stay on the defense of the others team so that they can score a goal. <p>
