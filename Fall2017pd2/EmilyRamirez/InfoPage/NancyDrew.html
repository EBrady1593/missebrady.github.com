		This is the Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys fan page. 
		The links connect to information about Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, and the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries show. 
		Both series of these books were written in the 1930's. The writer of the original Nancy Drew books wrote under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, and the writer of the original Hardy Boys series wrote under the name Franklin W. Dixon. 
		<h1> Nancy Drew </h1> 
		<br> <br> <br> 
		<p> This is Nancy Drew's part of this website.  Nancy Drew is an eighteen-year-old detective, although she likes to call herself a part-time investigator, 
		who lives in River Heights, believed to be in Illinois.  She is described as about 5'7" and pretty, with reddish blonde hair.  
			Her father, Carson Drew, is an attorney, and they help each other with their cases.  Nancy's mother died when Nancy was three, so her housekeeper Hannah Gruen 
			is the woman in her life who acts just like a mother to her. 
			Her friends Bess Marvin and Georgia (George) Fayne are cousins who are total opposites and come in handy a lot as help on her cases.  
			Her boyfriend, Ned Nickerson, goes to Emerson College and constantly tries to keep Nancy out of trouble. Unfortunately, his efforts sometimes aren't enough.  
			Nancy has earned her reputation by working on countless cases portrayed through many series of books, movies, and shows about her, most of which are shown here.
