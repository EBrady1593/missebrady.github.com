		This is the Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys fan page. 
		The links connect to information about Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, and the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries show. 
		Both series of these books were written in the 1930's. The writer of the original Nancy Drew books wrote under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, and the writer of the original Hardy Boys series wrote under the name Franklin W. Dixon.

		<h1> The Hardy Boys </h1> 
		This part of the webpage is dedicated to the Hardy Boys, the detective brothers.  The Hardy Boys live in Bayport in Barmet Bay, near the Atlantic Ocean.  
		Their father is Fenton Hardy, who is a detective also.  Their mother isn't mentioned as often but lives with them, and their Aunt Gertrude visits a lot, trying to keep the boys out of trouble. 
		Some of their friends are Chet Morton, Biff Hooper, and Tony Prito. 
		Joe's girlfriend is Iola Morton, Chet's sister, and Callie Shaw is Frank's girlfriend. 
		
		<br> <br> 
		 <p> Frank is the older brother, who is 18 years old.  He is very intelligent and responsible, but his brain instantly vanishes when he gets around girls. 
	He is the wiser one of the brothers and is always prepared.  Frank is described as having brown hair. </p> 
	<p> Joe is the younger brother, who is 17 years old.  He is intelligent, but gets distracted easily and cares a lot about having fun, which gets him off-track sometimes.  
	He is the goofier of the brothers and has an amazing sense of humor.  Joe is described as having blond hair. </p>
