		This is the Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys fan page. 
		The links connect to information about Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, and the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries show. 
		Both series of these books were written in the 1930's. The writer of the original Nancy Drew books wrote under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, and the writer of the original Hardy Boys series wrote under the name Franklin W. Dixon.
		 <br> <br> 
		 <h1> The Show </h1> 
		 This final page is dedicated to the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries Show that aired from 1977 to 1979.  There were three seasons.  
		 In the first one, Pamela Sue Martin played Nancy Drew, in the second one, Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew for some of the season, and in the third season, Nancy Drew was eliminated as a character. 
		Shaun Cassidy as Joe Hardy and Parker Stevenson as Frank Hardy stayed consistent throughout the show.
