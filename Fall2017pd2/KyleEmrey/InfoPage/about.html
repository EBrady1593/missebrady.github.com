			<h1>Biography of the Meme god </h1>
			<br><p> The Meme god, commonly known as Kyle Emrey, was born. He was born on earth, sadly.
			He grew up without knowing memes, and lived in the generation of memes. Once memes were popularized,
			he started to live and breathe memes. Every day for breakfast, a fresh bowl of memes.
			Three meals a day, 24/7, 365.
