			The Yankees have a lot of good players, too many to name, but I will name some of them.
			We'll start with their best player, Aaron Judge. Judge was a rookie this year and tore up the league
			by hitting the most homeruns, in one season, by a rookie ever. Next I'll talk about the ace of their
			pitching staff, Luis Severino. After a rough 2016 campaign Severino came back to go 14-6 with a 2.98
			era. Gary Sanchez rounds out one of the brightest looking big threes in all of baseball. Sanchez broke onto 
			the scene last year by hitting 20 homeruns in 53 games and followed that up by hitting 33 games while missing
			a whole month this season.
