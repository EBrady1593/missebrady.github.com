			Placement on the Court
		</article>
		<p> 	There are always 6 people on the court. How you know your placement is a number 1-6, on the net, or your stacked up at the net during a serve.<br>
		This is a picture of the number rotations. Number 1 is always server. So when you rotate through, everyone will serve. If you are opposite hitter(like I am), then you will always<br> be opposite of the setter. Which means if setter is serving at 1, then you are in 4 at the net. Before she serves, players are stacked up at the net so the other team can see where she is serving. Once they here the server serve the ball, you go to your home(placement on the court) and you begin to play. When the ball comes back you turn and be ready to play any ball that comes your way.
		 When you receve the ball again, the right side hitter is the server and you do the same thing you did when setter was serving.
