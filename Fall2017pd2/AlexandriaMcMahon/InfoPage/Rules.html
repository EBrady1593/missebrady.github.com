		<p> Rules are common in all sports. In volleyball, rules are used to either get points from other teams or steal the ball so we can ACE a serve and get a point.
		The rules include: When serving you can not step over the court line, If the ball goes out and your team touches it it's a point for the other team. Once a ball touches your hands, you can not touch it again until someone else sets it, makes a bad pass, a bad hit, or passes it back it, you may not go over or under the net to pass a ball.
