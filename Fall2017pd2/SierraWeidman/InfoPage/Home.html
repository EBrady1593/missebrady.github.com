			<p> Here is a little about her quoted straight by her from her YouTube bio! </p>
			<p> "Heya! My name is Vivienne, and I like to animate cartoons and songs! </p>
			<p> I am a grad of SVA in NYC, majoring in traditional animation, and I animate films based on the silly characters I keep coming up with! I have also taken to trying to fan animate some songs every now n' then. Songs that give me inspiration or direct visuals! Hope you enjoy! c: </p>

			<p> FAQ:
				"What programs do you use?" TV Paint for animation, Adobe premiere, After effects, Sai and Photoshop!
				"When is your next animation?" Animation takes time, but I'm almost always working on something! Soon as I can finish you'll see it!
				"What are these characters you draw from?" They are from my various projects, one being my webcomic "Zoophobia" and others!
				"Why is your taste in music such shit?" I dunno, maybe cause it's my taste in music, sorry it's not yours. </p>
