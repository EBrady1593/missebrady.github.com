				<h1>Hunting</h1>
				<p>The beagle is a breed of hunting dog that has been a popular human companion 
				for centuries. Beagles was originally bred for hunting dogs. When it comes to hunting 
				skills, the beagle is unquestionably top dog. The breed's talent was developed over
				centuries of hunting gopher, rabbit, and small game. In the 1800s, the beagle's 
				popularity began to dwindle as fox hunting became popular and the Foxhound stole the 
				limelight. But determined and passionate breeders kept the Beagle breed alive. Today, 
				this beloved hound is still one of the most popular breeds for hunting small game. </p>

				<h2> Competitions </h2>
				<p> The beagle is a great hunting dog that is why some people put them in competitions 
				that are field and show. In a beagle hound field trial, dogs run in packs of two or more to 
				follow a rabbit or hare. The goal is to follow the trail of a rabbit or hare, not to 
				harm them. Depending on which trial you participate in, your dog will be judged on his 
				ability to search and explore; to pursue and keep control of a trail; his accuracy in
				trailing; endurance; adaptability to changes in scenting conditions; patience; determination; 
				and more.In the show competitions, they are judge on the basic show quality 
				they have. But in the field, they are judge on their skills they have to run a rabbit. Also,
				if you get picked up in the field then you don't run anymore that day. Most of the 
				compettitions today are field ones since many people dropped away from show competitions. There
				are some people that still have show competitions with the field competitions.</p>
