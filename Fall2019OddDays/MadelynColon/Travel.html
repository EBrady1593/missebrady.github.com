<h1> History </h1>
<p> In 1502 when Christopher Columbus landed in Puerto Limon, less than 20 indigenous tribes 
occupied the lands which are now Costa Rica. The golden bands that the region's Carib Indian
wore as earrings and nose rings inspired the crew to name the country Costa Rica, meaning 
Rich Coast. While large-scale colonization was rampant in other Central American countries, 
few Spanish colonists claimed lands in Costa Rica due to the lack of mineral wealth 
(gold and silver) and an abundant Indian population to work the land. Initial attempts to
colonize coastal areas were unsuccessful due to the extreme heat, dense jungle and diseases 
such as Dengue fever and malaria.  As Costa Rica began to develop, these few families rich 
in land soon became some of the wealthiest in the country.</p>
<p> Costa Rica today  still has a large agricultural sector including coffee, banana, 
pineapple and sugar exports. In the last twenty years, eco-tourism and technology have taken
off and become top-earning industries in the country. Costa Ricans enjoy a high standard of 
living, and land ownership is widespread. </p>

<p> Costa Rica's geography reveals a history of cataclysm, with earthquakes, floods and 
volcanoes shaping its present day landscape. A diversity of soaring mountains, dormamt 
and active craters, black and white sand beaches, rushing rivers and powerful waterfalls
grace Costa Rica's 19,653 square miles, an area smaller than West Virginia. From north
to south and east to west, Costa Rica never measures longer or wider than 200 miles. Costa 
Rica is part of the Neotropic ecozone, and has both tropical and subtropical climates. The 
country is famous for its microclimates, which are created by the variations in weather and 
temperature seen through the nation. Also, Costa Rica's geography includes waterfalls all around Costa Rica. This is what some of the geography is like here at Costa
Rica. </p>
