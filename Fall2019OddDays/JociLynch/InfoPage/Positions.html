				<p> So at the very top are the strykers. There is a middle stryker and a left wing and a right wing.
				(Wing anf forward is short for 
				stryker)Forwards,also known as strikers, have the main objective of scoring goals. They are often 
				the player who get the most attention since their role is designed to be in a scoring Their main 
				job is offense and to score goals. In general, forwards must be fast and able to dribble the ball well.

<section id = "Mid-Field">
				<h2> Mid-Field</h2>
				<p> Mid-field are the people who stay in the middle that can score and 
defend. Midfielders spend a lot of time playing different roles in a game. This is
a very important position because they typically need to be good at defense and
 offense. You stay in the middle part of the field and you help on defense and offense. <br>

	  <section id = "defense">
				<h2>Defense</h2>
				<p>  Defense is a pretty hard position to play. You must keep the ball away from the goalie. When
				you get the ball, you must do everything in your power to get the ball awayfrom you and the back 
				line so the goalie does not have to get it. Defenders. Defenders do everything they can to make sure 
				that the ball does not get past them. If there is not a sweeper in play, defenders are the last 
				position the opposing team will encounteron their way to scoring a goal, besides the goalkeeper. 
				This position typically starts the game close to their own goal box. When the ball gets past 
				Mid-Field, it is up to the defenders to get it. The parents and whole team count on you. If 
				the other team scores a goal on your team, it is not the goalie's fault because it went through the 
				whole team and they let it past them. <br>

	  <section id = "goalie">
				<h2> Goalie</h2>
				<p> The only player allowed to handle the ball with their hands and arms is the goalie, which allows them to catch, punch, throw, and field high passes, 
				provided passes are not kicked directly to the goalie by a teammate, and the ball is not directly received from a throw-in. The goalie see's the whole field. 
They also give directions to the team. The goalie has to try to stop the ball by diving and catching and more.				<br>
