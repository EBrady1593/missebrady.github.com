In the north of sweden is really cold with snow caped/ covered mountins and extreamly thick forests. Central sweeden has the lower mountins and is almost completly dominated by them. In the west there is heavily vegitated/foristed hills/rideges, and there are meany rivers and around 101,000 lakes. On the border of sweden and norway lie the Scandinavian Mountains, there relitivitly low-leval mountains, as swedens heigest point stands just about 2,111 meters abouve sea leavel or 7,000ft(1.325758 miles ). some of sweedens largest riveres are Skellefte, Storuman, Torne and Ume Eman, Indal, Lagan, Ljusnan, Lule, Osterdal,Angerman, rivers.</p>
