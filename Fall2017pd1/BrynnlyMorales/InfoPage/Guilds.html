			<p> This is the first version of the Fairy Tail Guild. This Guild is where Natsu, Gray, Erza and so many more spent most of their life in. This guild is very importanat to Natsu because when his dragon, Igneel, left him without saying a word. He came here. The master of this guild found Natsu and he became a member. This is also the same guild for when Lucy joined too.</p>

			<p> This is the second or re-built version of the first guild but there are a few differences btween this guild and the first guild hall. This guild hall has a bigger job board to hold more job requests, it has a stage, a pool in the back and a booth to sell Fairy Tail itams like T-shirts and other things.</p>

			<p> This is the 7 year version of the second guild hall. The reason why it is 7 years into the future is because Natsu and some other guild members got attacked by a dragon while doing a race for the S class spot in the guild. But when the dragon did its attack, the atack wiped out the island along with Natsu and the others. But Natsu and the others were not hurt thanks to their first guild master, Mavis, who is a ghost. I honestly dont know who a ghost can save people who are alive but thats what happend.</p>
