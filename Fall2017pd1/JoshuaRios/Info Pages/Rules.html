			<p> When you break a rule in basketbal, it's called a <b>foul</b>.</p>
			<p> If you commit 6 fouls in a 48-minute game, you get ejected out of the game.</p>
			<p> There are multiple types of fouls, such as a shooting foul, a techincal foul, or a personal foul. </p>
			<p> A shooting foul is when the offenseive player goes up for a shot, but the defensive player hits his foreare, or any where else </p>
