			<h1> EVENTS </h1> 
			There are three events in a triathlon.  Those three events are swimming, biking, and running in that order. <br>

			The swimming leg in triathlon is often in open water instead of a pool. <br>

			When you go into the transition zone after the swim leg, you have to get everything ready for your biking leg <br> and get out of transition as quickly as possible. <br>

			After your bike leg, you come back to transition and again, as quickly as possible, you prepare for <br> and leave for the running leg ready to finish your triathlon. <br> 
			Just a note: <br>
			Transition is the spot where you store your bike, helmet, running shoes and anything else you might need for a triathlon. <br> You go to transition before the bike leg and after the bike leg. The clock doesn't stop while you are in transition so it is all about speed and completing your switch quickly.
