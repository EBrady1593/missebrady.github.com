			<p> TES 4: OBLIVION<br> The Elder Scrolls: IV takes place in Cyrodil, the heartland of Imperial Tamriel. Tamriel is a massive archipelago located on Mundus; the Mortal plane. Mundus is like Earth, but it has two moons: Masser and Secunda. Mundus was created by Lorkhan, a-now dead Aedra. The Nine Divines are a subcategory of Aedra, but I'll talk about them later. So Mundus exists in Nirn, which is the plane where Time exists. Time was created by Akatosh, the head of the Divines. But along with the Aedra exist the Daedra, and each of the 17 Daedric Princes dwell in their own Planes of Oblivion (the namesake of this game), shaped to their liking, within Nirn. The Daedra (also known as Daedric Princes) are evil, with a few exceptions like Meridia and sometimes Sheogorath. Anyways, you can probably infer from that that the antagonist of the story is a Daedric Prince, and you'd be right. Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of Destruction and Ambition. Now let us focus on The Empire. The Empire's influence is all nine provinces, and was unified by Tiber Septim, the first of the Dragonborn emperors. He also conquered Reman Cyrodill's Akiviri (basically samurai) and turned them into the Blades, his personal gaurdians. Upon his death, he was welcomed by the Eight Divines to become the Ninth for his great achievments. But before that, Akatosh gave him the new Empire a gift: The Amulet of Kings. Every time another Septim is put on the throne, he must light the Dragonfires in the Temple of One, an temple in the Imperial City. By doing this, it is made impossible for Daedra to enter over into Tamriel without being conjured. But the beginning of the game's plot begins with the Mythic Dawn, servants of Mankar Camoran's Cult of Mehrunes Dagon. Mankar Comoran assassinates all but one of the Emperor's sons, and the Emperor himself, leaving the Dragonfires to gradually extinguish. But there is still hope. In order to restore the barrier between Mundus and Oblivion, Martin Septim, last son of Uriel Septim, must obtain the Amulet of Kings and take it to the Temple of One to relight the Dragonfires. And you, the main character, must assist him.
