		<p> There are seven different dragon tribes in the war but only five of them are involved in the SandWing War of Succesion as it is later to be known.</p>
		<p> The first tribe is the one that the war is about, the SandWings. They are the tribe of dragons that live in the desert that takes up most of the continent of Pyhrria.
		SandWings are usually pale gold or white scales the color of desert sand. They also have a venomous barb on the end of their tails and forked black tounges and coal black eyes.
		They can survive long periods of time in the desert without food or water. They can also bury themselves under sand for camoflauge and can breathe fire.<br> <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.plus.scholastic.com/uploads/cms/9/cms/content_item/image/124/SunnyTheSandwing.png"> </p>
		<p> The next tribe are the MudWings. They gave thick armored brown scales, some times with amber or gold undersides. They also have large flat heads with nostrils on top of their snout. Mudwings can breathe fire but only if they are warm enough. They can also hold their breath for up to an hour. They can blend into mud puddles when laying still and they are usually very strong. <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.plus.scholastic.com/uploads/cms/9/cms/content_item/image/120/ClayTheMudwing.png"> </p>
		<p> The third dragon tribe are the Skywings. They are usually red-gold or orange and they have massive wings. They are extremley powerful fighters and they can fly faster than any of the other dragon tribes. They can also breathe fire. They are usually extremley grumpy. <img src = "http://www.supercoloring.com/sites/default/files/styles/coloring_medium/public/cif/2017/06/skywing-dragon-from-wings-of-fire-coloring-page.png"> </p>
		<p> The 4th tribe are the Seawings. They are usually blue or green or aquamarine in color and have webs between their claws. They also have gills on their necks and glow in the dark stripes along the length of their body. They can breathe underwater and see in the dark. They can also create large waves with one splash of their powerful tails. They are also excelent swimmers. <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.plus.scholastic.com/uploads/cms/9/cms/content_item/image/121/TsunamiTheSeawing.png"> </p>
		<p> The fifth tribe are the Icewings. They are silvery or pale blue in color. They have rigid claws, forked blue tounges, and tailsm that narrow to a whip-thin end. They can withstand subzero temperatures and bright light. They exhale a deadly freezing frostbreath and if it gets in your throat, you will die within a day. <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.plus.scholastic.com/uploads/cms/9/cms/content_item/image/125/Icewing.png"> </p>
		<p> The 6th dragon tribe are the Rainwings. Their scales shift color either based on emotions or the dragon's will. Thye also have prehensile tails. They can camoflauge to the background. They also use their prehensile tails to swing from tree branch to tree branch. They also shoot a deadly acid from their fangs. If it gets in your eyes or bloodstream you will be dead within minutes. If it only lands on scales you would wish you were dead. <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.plus.scholastic.com/uploads/cms/9/cms/content_item/image/122/GloryTheRainwing.png"> </p>
		<p> The final tribe are the Nightwings.  They are black/dark-purple/dark-green with a scattering of silver scales on the underside of their wings. They also have forked black tounges. They can breathe fire and dissapear into shadows. If they are hatched under 1 full moon they get either midreading or prophecy. If they hatch under 2 full moons they get both. If they hatch when all 3 moons are full then the powers become enhanced. They also really hate Icewings. <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.plus.scholastic.com/uploads/cms/9/cms/content_item/image/123/StarflightTheNightwing.png"> </p>
