		<p> Wings of Fire Information Page.<br> Wings of Fire is currently a 10 part book series with more on the way set in the fictional world of Pyhrria. The world in the first 5 books is at war and the war has lasted 20 years and many dragons have died. There is a prophecy fortelling the end of the war. Many, many dragons hope that the prophecy will come true soon because the war is getting ever more violent. The war is one of succesion. The SandWing Queen was killed 20 years ago by a scavenger (human) and none of the queen's daughters killed her so they couldn't decide which one of them would be queen. They split off to make alliances with dragons from other tribes. The last 5 books are set in a world of peace and the dragons from the prophecy have founded a school where all the dragon tribes come together to learn about each other and to help create peace.
