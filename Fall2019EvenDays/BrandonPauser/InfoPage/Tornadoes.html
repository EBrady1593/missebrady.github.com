Weak tornadoes have winds of less than 100 mile per hour winds, these tornadoes generally fall into the F0 and F1 catogories on the Fujita Scale. The damage from a weak tornado can include broken tree branches and peeling off roofs from houses and builidings.
				The next size is a strong tornado which makes up 29% of all tornadoes, these tornadoes cause 30% of all deaths from tornadoes. The winds speed range from 110 to 205 miles per hour.
				These tornadoes can reek havoc for 20 minutes or even longer. These strong tornadoes generally fall into the F2 and F3 catogories on the Fujita Scale and cause bed damage, they can demolish mobiles homes and overturn trains!
				The final size is violent which cause 70% of all deaths from tornadoes. These monsters can last for a whopping 60 minutes or more. The wind speeds for theses tornadoes is typically over 205 miles per hour! These tornadoes fall into F4 and F5 the 2 worst catogorie in the Fujita Scale.
