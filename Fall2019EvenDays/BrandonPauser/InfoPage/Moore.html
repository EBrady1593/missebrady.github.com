				<h1>Moore Oklahoma Tornado 2013 Before Disaster</h1>
				<p>This tornado struck at the worst time and also the most unexpected time, 2:56 P.M. This was bad because kids were still in school and daycares. There was 2 schools hit by the tornado, Briarwood Elementary School and Plaza Towers Elementary School. These students weren't unfamiliar with weather drills so they bunkered down and waited. To their surprise their school was in the direct path of the killer EF5 tornado. A daycare was also effect by the tornado and them too hunkered down and prepared.</p>

				<h1> Aftermath</h1>
			    <p>This tornado was 1.3 miles wide at its peak width and raked a 14 mile path and lasted for a whopping 77 minutes and cuased 2 billion dollars of damage. The people hunkering down during this monster were oblivious to fact that they would be apart of history for the rest of their life. All the people of Moore Oklahoma were surprised that they had gotten a tornado warning at around 2 or 2:30 because not many tornados occur at this hour, most tornadoes occured around 5 o'clock. Everyone was eager for weather reports and predictions of where the tornado was heading. Many homes and people were impacted by this killer tornado on May 20th 2013. Unfortunatly at the end of 77 minutes of terror there were 24 people that had passed, 7 of which were 3rd graders at plaza towers elementary school. Many people would develope PTSD everytime they see dark clouds outside again and no one effected by this tornado will ever forget this horrifying day.
