				<h1> Tornado Alley</h1>
				<p>The most well known hot spot around the world is tornado alley. This area contains much of northern Texas northward through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and parts of Louisiana, Iowa, Nebraska and eastern Colorado. This place is unlike any other place in the US, it is most prone to tornadoes because of air masses frequemtly colliding to produce strong and violent thunderstorms which in turn sets the stage for tornadoes.</p>

				<h6>Here is why tornadoes occur so often in tornado alley because of all the different air masses coming together in tornado alley.</h6>
